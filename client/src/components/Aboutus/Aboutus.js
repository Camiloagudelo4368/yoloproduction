                        <p>The concept started with two other ideas one of which consisted of an AI Apartment app and the other an app for a new type of restaurant.  Incorporating the two ideas we created an app that aids in weight loss by helping you monitor your calorie intake based on the closest restaurant and calories left to consume while motivating you with timelapsed photos of your physical changes.</p></p>
